# Runbook — releasing dig-relay (nightly cron + manual dispatch)

How this repo's `dig-relay` binary is built and released. The shape is copied from the ecosystem's
**reference nightlies system** (`dig-updater`, dig_ecosystem #590/#592); the normative contract is
`SPEC.md` §11.

## TL;DR

- Releases are **NOT cut on merge to `main`**. They are batched to a **nightly cron at midnight UTC**
  plus **manual dispatch**.
- **Stable** (`vX.Y.Z`): cut automatically when the `Cargo.toml` version was bumped (detected as
  "the `vX.Y.Z` tag doesn't exist yet"), or on demand. `prerelease: false`, marked `latest`.
- **Nightly**: built every night from `main` HEAD as a **pre-release** under a dated tag
  `nightly-YYYYMMDD` + a rolling `nightly` tag. `prerelease: true`, never `latest`. Keeps the newest
  14 dated nightlies.

## Prerequisites / credentials

- **`RELEASE_TOKEN`** — an org-level classic PAT (the ecosystem release token). Both channels no-op
  with a warning if it is absent. Used to push the changelog commit past branch protection and to
  push tags that trigger downstream workflows (`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot do either). Set org-wide, or per
  repo under Settings → Secrets → Actions.

## If nightlies silently stop — check for the 60-day cron auto-disable

GitHub disables a `schedule:` trigger after **60 days of no repo activity** on a public repo, with
**no automatic re-enable** — and since this cron is the *only* automatic release trigger (there is
no more push-to-main tagger), a quiet repo can go dark with no error anywhere. If nightlies (or a
long-overdue stable release) stop appearing:

```bash
gh api repos/DIG-Network/dig-relay/actions/workflows/nightly-release.yml --jq .state
# "disabled_inactivity" means GitHub turned it off — re-enable it:
gh workflow enable nightly-release.yml --repo DIG-Network/dig-relay
```

Any repo activity (a merged PR, a manual dispatch) resets the 60-day counter, so this normally only
bites a repo that goes fully quiet for two months. (Fleet-wide re-enable checking across every
releasing submodule is a standing loop-housekeeping concern, not something this repo checks for
its siblings.)

## Cut a STABLE release (the normal path)

1. In your feature PR, bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` per SemVer and run `cargo update -p dig-relay`
   (or `cargo update --workspace`) so `Cargo.lock` matches (the version-increment CI gate requires
   the bump; `--locked` builds require the lock in sync). Merge the PR (squash) as usual.
2. Nothing releases on merge. At the next **midnight UTC** the `nightly-release.yml` cron runs its
   **stable** job: it sees the new version has no `vX.Y.Z` tag, regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` with
   git-cliff, commits `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` to `main`, tags it, and pushes with `RELEASE_TOKEN`.
3. The pushed `v*` tag fires `release.yml`, which builds every OS/arch and publishes the stable
   GitHub Release (with the changelog as notes).

### Cut a stable release NOW (don't wait for midnight)

Actions → **Nightly + stable release** → **Run workflow** → `channel: stable` (or `both`) → Run.

### Re-cut / re-release the current version (e.g. after a failed build)

Actions → **Nightly + stable release** → **Run workflow** → `channel: stable`, **`force: true`** →
Run. `force` bypasses the skip-if-tagged guard and moves the existing `vX.Y.Z` tag onto a fresh
changelog commit (`main` is never force-pushed), re-firing `release.yml`.

`force` is guarded, not a blanket override: it REFUSES (non-zero exit, clear error) when the tag
already has a PUBLISHED release AND currently points at a different commit than this run would
build — that combination would silently overwrite a shipped release's binaries with different code
under the same version. It only proceeds for a same-commit retry (the failed-build case above) or a
tag with no published release yet. If you actually need to ship new code, bump `Cargo.toml` and let
a normal (non-force) run cut the next version instead.

## Cut a NIGHTLY on demand

Actions → **Nightly + stable release** → **Run workflow** → `channel: nightly` (or `both`) → Run. It
builds `main` HEAD, publishes/refreshes today's `nightly-YYYYMMDD` pre-release, moves the rolling
`nightly` tag to it, and prunes old nightlies.

## Verify a release went live

- **Stable:** `gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo DIG-Network/dig-relay` — 4 OS/arch assets,
  `prerelease: false`, marked latest. Watch the build: `gh run watch <id>`.
- **Nightly:** `gh release view nightly --repo DIG-Network/dig-relay` (rolling) or
  `gh release view nightly-YYYYMMDD` — `prerelease: true`, 4 assets stamped with the nightly version.

## Workflows

| File | Trigger | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `nightly-release.yml` | midnight-UTC cron + `workflow_dispatch` | Orchestrator: stable (changelog + tag) + nightly (build + pre-release + prune). |
| `release.yml` | `push: tags: v*` (+ dispatch canary) | Builds + publishes the stable Release for a `vX.Y.Z` tag. |
| `build-binaries.yml` | `workflow_call` | Reusable cross-OS build (both channels call it). |
| `ci.yml` | PR + push to main | The fmt/clippy/test/coverage gate (pre-merge). NOTE: `ubuntu-latest` only — cross-platform build breaks are first caught by the nightly channel, not PR CI (SPEC §11.6). |

## Local build (dev)

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
cargo test  --locked        # includes the workflow-shape guard tests
```
